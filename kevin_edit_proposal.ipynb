    "Drinking wine is an enjoyable pastime that many indulge in. To ensure customer satisfaction, it is of utmost importance for wine manufacturers to check the quality of their wine. Wine certification is normally done with the help of physicochemical tests revealing the wine’s physicochemical composition and sensory tests showing subjective assessments of wine quality (Nebot, Mugica, and Escobet, 2015, p. 501). An efficient prediction model based physicochemical variables that have a strong relationship with wine quality would greatly facilitate the certification process by eliminating the need for taste testers. The wine data used in this project was collected from May 2004 to February 2007 for red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine by the University of Minho in Guimaraes, Portugal and was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data consists of results of physicochemical tests of wine samples as well as sensory assessments of the wine quality by taste testers who graded the quality of the wine on a scale of one to ten. A list of all of the variables in the dataset is shown below (Nebot, Mugica, and Escobet, 2015, p. 504):\n",
    "* Fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* Volatile acidity (g(acetic acid)/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* Citric acid (g/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* Residual sugar (g/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* Chlorides (g(sodium chloride)/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* Free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* Total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* Density (g/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* pH\n",
    "* Sulfates (g(potassium sulfate)/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "* Alcohol (%vol)\n",
    "* Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the proposal, it was found that alcohol, density, chlorides, and volatile acidity were the strongest predictors for wine quality. Knowing this as well as the physicochemical composition of the wine samples and the sensory assessment of the samples, our project aims to answer the following question: how do alcohol, density, chlorides, and volatile acidity predict the quality of the wine? \n"

    "We can see that alcohol, density, chlorides, and volatile acidity are weakly-to-moderately correlated with wine quality; therefore, we will use these variables for our models. In order to conduct our data analysis, we will first use a multivariate K-nearest neighbors-based approach and perform cross-validation to determine at which value of K the minimum RMSPE occurs. Using this K value, we will re-train our KNN regression model and then make predictions on the testing data set. The RMSPE will let us evaluate our model's accuracy. We will also use a multiple linear regression approach to calculate the line of best fit, including the intercept and slope coefficients, and we will evaluate any outliers. We will again compute the RMSPE. We will choose the model with the least bias (i.e., the lower RMSPE). If the linear regression model is the better fit, we will visualise our data using a flat plane; otherwise, we will use a flexible plane."

    "Through our linear multiple regression analysis, we expect to get a fitted linear equation with an intercept and slope coefficients that we can use to get a predicted value of wine quality when we know the values of certain correlated variables. Through our KNN regression analysis, we will be able to get a predicted value of wine quality by examining the values of certain correlated variables that a particular sample of wine possesses and finding the nearest neighbours of those datapoints. Through our findings, we expect to be able to significantly predict subjective assessments of wine quality by collecting data about a wine sample's physicochemical properties (alcohol, density, chlorides, and volatile acidity).\n",
