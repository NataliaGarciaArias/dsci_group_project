    "We can see that fixed acidity, volatile acidity, residual sugar, free sulfur dioxide, and alcohol are moderately correlated with wine quality. In order to conduct our data analysis, we will first use a multivariate K-nearest neighbors-based approach and perform cross-validation to determine at which value of K the minimum RMSPE occurs. Using this K value, we will re-train our KNN regression model and then make predictions on the testing data set. The RMSPE will let us evaluate our model's accuracy. We will also use a multiple linear regression approach to calculate the line of best fit, including the intercept and slope coefficients, and we will evaluate any outliers. We will again compute the RMSPE. We will choose the model with the least bias (i.e., the lower RMSPE). If the linear regression model is the better fit, we will visualise our data using a flat plane; otherwise, we will use a flexible plane."
